Game Name
---------------
POKEMON FIGHTER

Description
---------------
This game was inspired by the Nintendo GameCube title Super Smash Bros. Melee which was released in North America December 3, 2001. Our variation focuses strictly on Pokemon, whereas the original contains characters from various Nintendo gaming franchises including Mario, and The Legend of Zelda. SSBM approached the fighter genre differently than most as percentage counters measure the level of damage received, rather than the health bar traditionally seen in most fighting games. Furthermore, inflicting the most damage to the other player does not guarantee victory. Rather, the goal is to force the opposing player beyond the boundaries of the stage by knocking them back. The higher the damage percentage, the further a player gets knocked back. Our Pokemon centered version has each player controlling the games most popular character Pikachu. All sound effects, game music, characters, and screen images are Pokemon franchise influenced content.

Optimal Strategy
---------------
Use roll to reposition character if nearing the stage boundaries since player is invincible while rolling. Shielding is also important to avoid taking damage. Jumping forward/backwards is useful for covering ground quicker than standard directional movement alone. You can also jump over your opponent to avoid their attack since collision is the only way to take damage.
